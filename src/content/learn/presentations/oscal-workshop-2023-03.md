{{% usa-tag %}}Purpose{{% /usa-tag %}} The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) co-hosted with the Department of Commerce on Tuesday, May 23rd, 2023, the fourth annual conference in the series focusing on the Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL). The conference was in person at the Herbert C. Hoover Federal Building (HCHB) in Washington DC (see address) in Washington DC, and was followed by a half-day educational workshop on May 24. The conference and the workshop was free to attend.

OSCAL is a standardized, flexible, open-source language that allows security controls and their associated implementations and assessment methods to be expressed in machine-readable formats and easy transformation to human-friendly representations.

OSCAL sets a standards-based foundation for the next generation of compliance processes and GRC tools by facilitating security automation, with a particular focus on the continuous authorization to operate (ATO) processes and continuous monitoring, and improved risk management, aiming to eliminate major challenges fueled by paper-based, human-driven security assessment process against multiple regulatory frameworks, especially in the context of complex, stacked systems.

The conference highlighted the latest development of NIST OSCAL models and explored OSCAL-based automation of risk management, governance, and compliance processes and tools for different national and international regulatory frameworks. Our presenters, some of the most prestigious cybersecurity experts who share the same passion for new advancements in security automation, shared their innovative OSCAL-based solutions, demonstrating, in the process, OSCAL's international adoption. 

Attendees were:

- Leaders in digital transformation and security automation from the government, private, and academic sectors;
- Vendors of security automation tools who are considering implementing OSCAL formats in their tools;
- Participants in standard development organizations focusing on developing and publishing control catalogs and baselines;
- System owners from the government, private, and academic sectors, who want to streamline the documentation of controls used in their information systems.
